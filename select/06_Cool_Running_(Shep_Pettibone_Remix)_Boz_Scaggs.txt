Hot night, she's running right
Magic's in the air
So what do I care?
The running red straight ahead
Sets my soul on fire
Taking it higher

Cool running, cool
The message from the coast is loud and clear
Cool running, yeah (Cool running)
Cool running, cool
The second I get off, I'm out of here
Cool running, yeah (Cool running, yeah)
Ooh-ooh

I'm east out, chilling out
The boss is on the phone
Tell him I'm gone
That's right, so I
Will blow her love blues away
Call her back another day

Cool running, cool
Ain't got no time for talking to no one
Cool running, yeah (Cool running)
Cool running, cool
Send them all a postcard from the zone
Cool running, yeah (Cool running, yeah)

Cool running

You see, it is, is like this
We're about to lose control
Well, it beats getting old
Hey, bee-dee-dee-dee, bee-dee

Cool running, cool
Predictions for the coast say bright and clear
Cool running, yeah (Cool running)
Cool running, cool
The forecast for my head is out of here
Cool running, yeah (Cool running, yeah)

Cool running, cool
The message from the coast is bright and clear
Cool running, cool running
Cool running, cool
The second I get off, I'm out of here
Cool running, yeah (Cool running now)
Cool running, cool
Oh doctor man, I hope relief soon comes
Cool running, yeah (Cool running)
Cool running, cool
Sometimes the best prescription is to run
Cool running, yeah (Cool running)
Cool running, cool
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Cool running)
Cool running, cool running
Cool running, cool
